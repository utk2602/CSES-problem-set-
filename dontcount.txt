i dont have an idea for now maybe i have a solution for same characters but for different characters i dont know what i should be doing 
maybe it can be done in python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    m = int(input())
    x =input()
    s =input()
    k=0
    while(s not in x ):
        x=x+x
        k=k+1
    print(k)    i am using this code but i am getting runtime error
